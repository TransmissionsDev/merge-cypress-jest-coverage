# merge-cypress-jest-coverage

### Merge your Cypress and Jest coverage reports with ease.

This script is inspired by this example of merging Cypress & Jest reports: https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-and-jest

## Usage:

- Run your Cypress tests and output coverage to a `cypress-coverage/` directory.
- Run your Jest tests and output coverage to a `jest-coverage/` directory.
- Run `npx merge-cypress-jest-coverage` and check the `coverage/` directory for the merged report!
